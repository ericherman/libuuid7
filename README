Experimenting with a sortable UUID format.

This draft:
 https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-peabody-dispatch-new-uuid-format-04.html

Seems to differ slightly from the python docs:
 https://pypi.org/project/uuid7/

This roughly follows the python docs.


Usage
-----

	uint8_t uuid_bytes[16];

	uuid7(uuid_bytes);

	char buf[37];

	printf("uuid: %s\n", uuid7_to_string(buf, sizeof(buf), uuid_bytes));

Threads
-------

In order to provide the sequence number for a UUID, the last time and last
sequence are stored in a global variable.

In a multi-threaded program, it's important to ensure that these values are
accessed in a thread-safe fashion.

Unless compiled with -DUUID7_SKIP_MUTEX, thread-safety can be achieved by
first calling:

	uuid7_mutex_init();

After that, any calls to uuid7 will be thread-safe.

The mutex destructor is:

	 uuid7_mutex_destroy();

In a single threaded environment, these may be skipped.
