Experimenting with a sortable UUID format.

This draft:
 https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-peabody-dispatch-new-uuid-format-04.html

Seems to differ slightly from the python docs:
 https://pypi.org/project/uuid7/

This roughly follows the python docs.


Usage
-----

	uint8_t uuid_bytes[16];

	uuid7(uuid_bytes);

	char buf[37];

	printf("uuid: %s\n", uuid7_to_string(buf, sizeof(buf), uuid_bytes));


To do
-----

At the moment, it is not thread-safe.
